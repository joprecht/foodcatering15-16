= Kickstart

The kickstart module is a template project to bootstrap the Java project in the Software Engineering lab.
The project is supposed to be copied into the group's repository to get it started easily.
It contains the following features:

* a skeleton Java 8 web application based on Spring Boot and Salespoint framework (see `src/main/java`)
* a placeholder Asciidoc file in `src/main/asciidoc` for documentation
